# Database and API documentation

This portal collects and visualises datasets concerning the [Maritime Encounters](https://www.gu.se/en/research/maritime-encounters) project.

The portal is realised by [InfraVis](https://infravis.se/) and maintained by the Gothenburg Research Infrastructure in Digital Humanities (GRIDH) at the University of Gothenburg in collaboration with members of the project. The frontend is developed and maintained by Dr. Matteo Tomasini, starting from a tool created and maintained by Associate Professor Jonathan Westin and MA Tristan Bridge. The backend and database were built by MSc Aram Karimi and maintained in collaboration with Prof. Marc Vander Linden, Dr. Micheal McGuire and Dr. Matteo Tomasini. Please contact matteo.tomasini(at).lir.gu.se if you have any questions about the portal.
