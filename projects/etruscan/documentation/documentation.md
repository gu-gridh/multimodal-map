# Database and API documentation 
This portal collects and visualises datasets concerning Etruscan chamber tombs. The first dataset, encompassing the necropoleis/necropolises around San Giovenale, originated from the doctoral thesis 'The Chamber Tombs of San Giovenale and the Funerary Landscapes of South Etruria' by Dr. Fredrik Tobin-Dodd. The portal was realised by the Gothenburg Research Infrastructure in Digital Humanities (GRIDH) at the University of Gothenburg in collaboration with the Swedish Institute of Classical Studies in Rome. The project was developed by Associate Professor Jonathan Westin (project lead, design), together with M.A Tristan Bridge (Frontend development) and Dr. Matteo Tomasini (backend development). Dr. Fredrik Tobin-Dodd – whose thesis served as foundation for the project – provided the content for the San Giovenale tombs, and aided the project with expertise. The project was overseen by Associate Professor Ulf R. Hansson, Director of the Swedish Institute in Rome and Dr. Hampus Olsson, Senior Lecturer at the same institute.
